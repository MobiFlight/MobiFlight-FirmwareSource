# MobiFlight-FirmwareSource

PlatformIO version of the MobiFlight firmware source.

To build:

1. Install [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download)
2. Install the [PlatformIO extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=platformio.platformio-ide). Visual Studio Code will automatically
   suggest this extension if you don't already have it installed.
3. From the Command Palette select `PlatformIO: Build` to build or `PlatformIO: Upload` to build and upload to your connected board

If you want to speed up local development and only build for one of the supported platforms then click on the `Default (MobiFlight-FirmwareSource)` label
in the Visual Studio Code status bar and then select the specific target platform you want to build for.
