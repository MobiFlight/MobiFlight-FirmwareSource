# MobiFlight-FirmwareSource

PlatformIO version of the MobiFlight firmware source.

To build:

1. Install [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download)
2. Install the [PlatformIO extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=platformio.platformio-ide). Visual Studio Code will automatically
   suggest this extension if you don't already have it installed.
3. From the Command Palette select `PlatformIO: Build` to build or `PlatformIO: Upload` to build and upload to your connected board

If you want to speed up local development and only build for one of the supported platforms then click on the `Default (MobiFlight-FirmwareSource)` label
in the Visual Studio Code status bar and then select the specific target platform you want to build for.

## Publishing a release

To publish a new release:

1. Go to the [GitHub Releases page](https://github.com/MobiFlight/MobiFlight-FirmwareSource/releases) and
click the `Draft a new release` button.
2. Click `Choose a tag` and create a new version tag, e.g. `1.14.0`
3. Enter a title and release notes.
4. Optionally check `This is a pre-release` if the release should be for testing purposes and not be marked
as the latest published release.
5. Click `Publish release`.

The release build process will automatically run and after a few minutes attach firmware binaries
for the release to the release page.

If a release was marked as pre-release you can go back later and edit it to remove the pre-release designation
which will automatically promote it to the latest published release.
